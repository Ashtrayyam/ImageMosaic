This is an image processing software developed with java for my fourth year undergrad class.
Combining both my technical and artistic skills, this software can automatically composite an image mosaic base on any original image thrown in the folder.
By adjusting different filters such as tile size, colour correction and brightness correction, users can create an image mosaic of their preferences.
